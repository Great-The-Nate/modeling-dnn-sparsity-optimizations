    "In this artifact, we provide evaluation setups for the important experiments (the motivating example, validations for accelerator designs, and the case study). Please follow the instructions in each cell to run the evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each experiment, we give a *very conservative estimate* of how long the runs will take. The input specifications and related scripts can be found in `../evaluation_setups`. **The easiest way to validate the outputs is to compare the generated figure/table to the figure/table in the paper**, but we do provide a `ref_outputs` folder for each evaluation for more detailed comparison of results if necessary.\n",
